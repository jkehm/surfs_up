## Module 9 Challenge

#### Overview
In this Module we have helped W. Avy create an analysis for opening an Ice Cream Shop in Hawaii. Before we opened this store on a whim, W. Avy wanted to look into weather data for the area to make sure it's a good idea to open an Ice Cream Shop. To complete this analysis, he would like temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu. This way we can make sure that the business will be sustainable year-round. 

Deliverables for this analysis include
* Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
* Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
* Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis (README.md)
#### Results
Below are screenshots of the two summary statistics that were created for June and December.
