## Module 9 Challenge

## Overview
In this Module we have helped W. Avy create an analysis for opening an Ice Cream Shop in Hawaii. Before we opened this store on a whim, W. Avy wanted to look into weather data for the area to make sure it's a good idea to open an Ice Cream Shop. To complete this analysis, he would like temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu. This way we can make sure that the business will be sustainable year-round. 

Deliverables for this analysis include
* Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
* Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
* Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis (README.md)
## Results
Below are screenshots of the two summary statistics that were created for June and December.

* The average temperature is about 4 degrees Fahrenheit warmer in the Summer than the winter
* The minimum value is 8 degrees Fahrenheit colder in the winter
* We did get about 200 less data points in December than in June


## Summary
Overall, the weather does not change very drastically between the Summer and Winter according to this data. Which is a great sign for the sustainability of this business, additionally the standard deviation is very similar between the two, which indicates that the temperatures doesn't change a lot more in the Winter than in the Summer. 

As per usual there is a lot more we could do with this data. 
* One idea, would be to create a query that sorts by Station ID number, and views the temperature averages for the months of June and December, then another table could be created that shows these numbers side-by-side.
* Another interesting piece of data to examine would be the precipitation amounts for each month, and compare them to see if there is a chance of rain-out being a common issue in the winter months.
